/*
This is a hashset implementation by William Kraft (ZekeWK).

It is NOT YET TESTED properly.

As I am a novice in C, I leave no guarantees as to the quality, speed, or correctness of the code.
 
While it is written primarily as a hashset, it can be used as a hashmap by only using the key in the hash and eq functions supplied to the hashset_create function.

It uses an open addressing double hashing algorithm.

By doing this operation the len is changed which changes the way items would be inserted and found. One should therefore not use any other functions on a partially drained hashset. The elements are not removed when draining, and by changing the len to its original, the hashset would be restored.  After having drained a set completly, every pointer inserted into the hashset should have been return exactly once from either hashset_insert, hashset_pop or hashset drain, it is therefore safe to use for memory manangement.
